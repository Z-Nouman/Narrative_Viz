        <h2>Total Cases / Deaths in the United States (Feb 2020 - May 2023)</h2>

        <div id="viz_div"></div>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;However, when looking at new cases and deaths for each month during the pandemic for just the United States, we see a different story. 
            Immediately when the pandemic began, we see the United States wasn't prepared, and hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, leading to many deaths. 
            The CDC released new advice related to health precautions around staying indoors, wearing a mask in public, avoiding small gatherings, and avoid travel unless essential.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;We see this seems to have slowed down the spread, and the number of cases and deaths seemed to become steady rather than rapidly explode, at least until winter. 
            Here we see some periodicity, where it seems during the winter season for all years of the pandemic, there is a rise in cases, and as a direct result, deaths as well. 
            This can be explained by the season being cold so people want to be indoors, as well as the holiday season being a reason to visit family and hold gatherings. 
            This first swell is followed by the largest swell in deaths across the entire pandemic, as well as the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines to the public in December 2020. 
            The number of cases then seems to decrease, until another factor strikes: disease variants, and specifically the delta variant of COVID-19</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;This variant, while less deadly, was more contagious and more resistant to the vaccine, resulting in the largest swell in COVID-19 cases the following winter season (December 2021 and January 2022). 
            Despite the massive number of cases though, the disease was less deadly and the United States has had two years to adjust the pandemic and supply hospitals with the resources necessary to handle any severe cases. So despite this swell in cases, there wasn't a matching swell in deaths like there was the previous year in 2020 and early 2021.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;From here, we see cases and deaths slowly fizzle out, as the disease evolves to become more contagious and less deadly, as well as more adults becoming vaccinated.</p>
