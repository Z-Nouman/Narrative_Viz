            <p>&emsp;&emsp;In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. In May 2023, the WHO declared an end to the global health emergency. However, during this period, countless got sick due to COVID-19, and many died as a result. It is important to look back in retrospect on the data we've collected to evaluate certain responses and decisions, as well as if we can find any patterns or lessons within the data to learn for the future.</p>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;This is a narrative visualization of that data, provided by <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">"Our World in Data"</a> and collected from many sources. The data is displayed throughout these visualizations was preprocessed to aggregate the data to monthly periods for ease of visualization and to reduce the total amount of data needed to be retrieved at the time a page is loaded. This visualization will try to answer the following question: How well did the United States handle the pandemic in terms of governmental response and cultural response?</p>
