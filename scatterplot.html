        <h2>Global comparison of total cases and deaths due to COVID-19 (May 2023)</h2>
        <h5>Country name displayed by hovering over each data point</h4>
        <div id="viz_div"></div>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;First, let's take a look at how each country handled the overall pandemic in terms of total cases and deaths per 1,000,000 people by May 2023. 
            We immediately see a cluster of Asian countries clustered together on the left of the chart. 
            It's possible this is due to under reporting of cases / deaths, strict lockdown procedures, or possibly due to the culture accepting the use of face coverings and masks in public. 
            Despite these, we see countries with densely populated areas such as South Korea and Japan with a large number of cases per million people, but doing well taking care of those who are sick based on the low number of deaths per million people.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;We also see many Western European countries (such as Spain, Sweden, and Belgium) and the United States closer to the center of the chart. Here we can see while the United States did not have strict lockdowns, it doesn't seem to have an excessive amount of cases or deaths per million people.</p>
