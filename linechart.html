        <p>&emsp;&emsp;So how did the United States do compared to other western countries? 
            Well, despite having similar total cases and deaths per million compared to other western European countries such as France, we see a disproportionate number of deaths related to the delta variant in early 2022. 
            For example, while the United States had a higher death per million people in 2022 and onwards than France, France had significantly more COVID-19 cases. 
            This means for those sick with COVID-19, France had better healthcare than the United States, resulting in mortality that could've been avoided if provided the proper resources and policy making.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;The above chart can be modified to compare any two countries of your choice (provided there is data for it), as well as the metric to display over time (new_cases / new_deaths / total_cases_per_million / total_deaths_per_million).
            This chart, and the previous ones, provide context into how the United States handled the pandemic, showing how unprepared the world was for it at the start (and how essential lockdowns were to slow down the spread and provide time to ramp up healthcare resources), as well as specifically how
            mishandled the second wave of COVID-19 was in the United States, with cultural arguments occuring on social distancing, mask usage in public, and general policy making to prevent excess deaths due to COVID-19.
